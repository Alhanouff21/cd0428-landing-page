# Project Title
# Landing Page Project

# Description
i've add 3 main changes in the javascript file 
- add the nav on the web page and made it dynamic so every-time a section is added it gets added in the nav
- made the active class for each section when the user scrolls down the page with the help and guide in the project i used <b>getBoundingClientRect()</b> to get the size and position 
- the last change is an event when the user clicks between the section in the nav bar
